## Features

- **Cross-Browser Testing:** Execute tests across Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit browsers.
- **Headless Execution:** Support for running tests without a GUI, enhancing performance and integration capabilities.
- **Robust Selectors:** Utilize user-facing attributes and roles for reliable element targeting.
- **Comprehensive Test Suites:** Includes a variety of test cases covering different user interactions and edge cases.
